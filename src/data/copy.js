{"label":"portfolio","name":"Portfolio Investment Openness","definition":"Portfolio investment openness refers to limited controls on two-way cross-border investment into equities, debt, and other financial instruments. Portfolio investment openness is a key ingredient for financial market efficiency and market-driven exchange rate adjustments in open market economies.","context":"China has historically tightly controlled portfolio investment flows to maintain control over its exchange rate and domestic interest rates. In the past three years Beijing has accelerated reforms to gradually reduce restrictions on portfolio flows. It scrapped its long-standing inbound quota system (QFII) and established “connect” schemes for foreigners to access stock and bond markets within pre-defined quotas. It has also made regulatory changes to facilitate the inclusion of onshore securities in major global indices. However, outbound flows remain tightly restricted and state-driven, and foreign investors lack sufficient hedging tools in onshore markets."},
{"label":"FDI","name":"Direct Investment Openness","definition":"Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) openness refers to fair, non-discriminatory access for foreign firms to domestic markets and freedom for domestic companies to invest abroad without restrictions or political mandates. FDI openness is a key feature of open market economies to encourage competitive markets and facilitate the global division of labor based on comparative advantages.","context":"Beijing has gradually opened to inbound FDI by moving from an approval-based system to a negative list-based system and reducing restricted sectors for foreign investment, but foreign and domestic investments are not treated equally in many sectors of the economy. Chinese companies continue to face major restrictions and political interventions for overseas investments, and those restrictions have increased since 2016."},
{"label":"Innovation","name":"Modern and Open Innovation System","definition":"Market economies rely on innovation to drive competition, increase productivity, and create wealth. Innovation system designs vary across countries, but market economies generally employ systems that rely on government funding for basic research but emphasize private sector investment; encourage the commercial application of knowledge through the strong protection of intellectual property rights, and encourage collaboration with and participation of foreign firms and researchers.","context":"While China has a storied history of invention and produces renowned innovators, its innovation system has diverged from advanced market economies in important ways throughout the modern era. Even as China is reaching middle income status, its innovation system continues to feature (1) compulsive technology policies; (2) preponderance of state intervention and industrial policies across a wide range of technologies; (3) strong biases in support of domestic firms and researchers; and (4) lax credit terms at volume in support of innovation. Under President Xi’s leadership, China has doubled down on these policies in recent years. This has led to global concerns about Chinese innovation mercantilism and possible negative impacts on global innovative capacity in the long run."},
{"label":"competition","name":"Market Competition","definition":"Market economies rely on a pro-competitive environment where firms face low entry/exit barriers, market power abuses are disciplined, consumer interests are prioritized, government participation in the marketplace is limited and justified by clear pro-competitive principles. ","context":"China transitioned since 1978 from a planned economy to a hybrid model that combines state and market forces. Beijing has pledged repeatedly to make further progress toward cementing the “decisive role” of markets in directing the allocation of economic resources over the past decades, but that convergence with economic liberalism has slowed. Competition is robust in some areas while others remain dominated by government direction and influence, and state reach into commerce has generally expanded in recent years. Subsidies, political directed lending rates and input costs, discriminatory regulation and other factors distort market outcomes and make it difficult to situate the boundary between state and market."},
{"label":"financial","name":"Financial System Development","definition":"Open market economies rely on modern financial systems for the efficient pricing of risk and allocation of capital. Key pillars of modern financial systems are market-driven credit pricing, availability of a broad range of financial instruments, the absence of distortive administrative controls on credit price and quantity, and access for foreign firms to financial services and foreign exchange markets.","context":"China’s financial system is dominated by state-related banks and political considerations. This promoted faster growth in the past but imposes a heavy toll on efficiency, structural adjustment and market allocation of capital as the nation reaches higher income levels. Reliance on this system for growth and stability stymies reforms, capital market deepening, non-bank financial institution growth, and openness to foreign competition. Market-determined interest rates – fundamental to market economies – are missing, causing the system – and risks associated with it -- to balloon beyond other economies. This is increasingly seen abroad as distorting fair trade and competition, thus justifying anti-subsidies policies toward China.  By trying too hard to prevent financial stress, the state has created it: the consequences of transitioning from the status quo are increasingly unpalatable to leaders."}]
