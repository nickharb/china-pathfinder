title,intro,Where Does China’s Economy Stand?,"China is a global economic powerhouse, but its system remains opaque. Policymakers and financial experts disagree on basic facts about what is happening inside the country. To create a shared language for understanding the Chinese economy, the China Pathfinder project scores China and other open market economies across six key areas and presents an objective picture of China relative to the world.",,

main,growth,Financial System Development,"A system that efficiently prices credit, allocates capital based on market signals, and provides foreign firms with access to financial services.","Open market economies rely on modern financial systems for the efficient pricing of risk and allocation of capital. Key pillars of modern financial systems are market-driven credit pricing, availability of a broad range of financial instruments, the absence of distortive administrative controls on credit price and quantity, and access for foreign firms to financial services and foreign exchange markets. ","China’s financial system is dominated by state-related banks and political considerations. This promoted faster growth in the past but imposes a heavy toll on efficiency, structural adjustment and market allocation of capital as the nation reaches higher income levels. Reliance on this system for growth and stability stymies reforms, capital market deepening, non-bank financial institution growth, and openness to foreign competition. Market-determined interest rates – fundamental to market economies – are missing, causing the system – and risks associated with it -- to balloon beyond other economies. This is increasingly seen abroad as distorting fair trade and competition, thus justifying anti-subsidies policies toward China. By trying too hard to prevent financial stress, the state has created it: the consequences of transitioning from the status quo are increasingly unpalatable to leaders."
main,competition,Market Competition,"An environment where firms face low entry/exit barriers, market power abuses are disciplined, and distortive interventions are minimized.","Market economies rely on a pro-competitive environment where firms face low entry/exit barriers, market power abuses are disciplined, consumer interests are prioritized, government participation in the marketplace is limited and justified by clear pro-competitive principles. ","China transitioned since 1978 from a planned economy to a hybrid model that combines state and market forces. Beijing has pledged repeatedly to make further progress toward cementing the “decisive role” of markets in directing the allocation of economic resources over the past decades, but that convergence with economic liberalism has slowed. Competition is robust in some areas while others remain dominated by government direction and influence, and state reach into commerce has generally expanded in recent years. Subsidies, political directed lending rates and input costs, discriminatory regulation and other factors distort market outcomes and make it difficult to situate the boundary between state and market."
main,innovation,Modern Innovation System,A market-led system that fosters productivity through private-public cooperation and international collaboration.,"Market economies rely on innovation to drive competition, increase productivity and create wealth. Innovation system designs vary across countries, but market economies generally employ systems that rely on government funding for basic research but emphasize private sector investment; encourage the commercial application of knowledge through the strong protection of intellectual property rights; and encourage collaboration with and participation of foreign firms and researchers.","While China has a storied history of invention and produces renowned innovators, its innovation system has diverged from advanced market economies in important ways throughout the modern era. Even as China is reaching middle income status, its innovation system continues to feature (1) compulsive technology policies; (2) preponderance of state intervention and industrial policies across a wide range of technologies; (3) strong biases in support of domestic firms and researchers; and (4) lax credit terms at volume in support of innovation. Under President Xi’s leadership, China has doubled down on these policies in recent years. This has led to global concerns about Chinese innovation mercantilism and possible negative impacts on global innovative capacity in the long run."
main,trade,Trade Openness,Goods and services trade free from discriminatory measures and restrictions.,"Free trade is a key feature of open market economies to facilitate specialization based on comparative advantage. We define trade openness as cross-border flow of market-priced goods and services free from discriminatory, excessively burdensome, or restrictive measures.","Free trade is a key feature of open market economies to facilitate specialization based on comparative advantage. We define trade openness as cross-border flow of market-priced goods and services free from discriminatory, excessively burdensome, or restrictive measures."
main,fdi,Direct Investment Openness,Fair access for foreign firms to domestic markets alongside minimal restrictions on local companies to invest abroad.,"Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) openness refers to fair, non-discriminatory access for foreign firms to domestic markets and freedom for domestic companies to invest abroad without restrictions or political mandates. FDI openness is a key feature of open market economies to encourage competitive markets and facilitate the global division of labor based on comparative advantages.","Beijing has gradually opened to inbound FDI by moving from an approval-based system to a negative list-based system and reducing restricted sectors for foreign investment, but foreign and domestic investments are not treated equally in many sectors of the economy. Chinese companies continue to face major restrictions and political interventions for overseas investments, and those restrictions have increased since 2016."
main,portfolio,Portfolio Investment Openness,"Limited controls on cross-border investment into equities, debt and other financial instruments.","Portfolio investment openness refers to limited controls on two-way cross-border investment into equities, debt and other financial instruments. It is a key ingredient for financial market efficiency and market-driven exchange rate adjustments in open market economies.","China has historically tightly controlled portfolio investment flows to maintain control over its exchange rate and domestic interest rates. In the past three years Beijing has accelerated reforms to gradually reduce restrictions on portfolio flows. It scrapped its long-standing inbound quota system (QFII) and established “connect” schemes for foreigners to access stock and bond markets within pre-defined quotas. It has also made regulatory changes to facilitate the inclusion of onshore securities in major global indices. However, outbound flows remain tightly restricted and state-driven, and foreign investors lack sufficient hedging tools in onshore markets."

trade,3,"Trade Barriers: Tariffs; Tariff rate, most favored nation, simple mean, all products, percent. ",Simple mean most-favored nation tariff rate is the unweighted average of most-favored nation rates for all products subject to tariffs calculated for all traded goods. We use the simple average tariff rate because the weighted average could skew the outcome if certain countries had high product-import shares corresponding to limited partner countries. ,,
trade,4,"Trade Barriers: Services Trade; Services Services Trade Openness Index, range is 0–1 where 1 is most open.","The STRI measures policy restrictions on traded services across four major sectoral categories.
